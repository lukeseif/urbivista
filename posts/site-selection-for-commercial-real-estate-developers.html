          For commercial real estate (CRE) developers, site selection isn’t just a “where.” It’s the foundation for approvals, underwriting, leasing,
          and long-term asset performance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 26px;">CRE development is an approval + leasing business</h2>
      <p>
        A great site makes everything easier: entitlement conversations, stakeholder alignment, tenant interest, and investor confidence.
        A weak site creates friction everywhere: public pushback, uncertain demand, and slower leasing velocity.
        That’s why <strong>site selection for commercial real estate development</strong> should be defensible, documented, and repeatable.
      </p>

      <h2>What “defensible” site selection means for developers</h2>
      <p>
        Defensible site selection uses <strong>location intelligence</strong> to clearly explain:
        (1) what demand exists, (2) what risks exist, (3) which assumptions drive the pro forma, and (4) what would change the recommendation.
      </p>

      <h2>Five ways location intelligence helps commercial real estate developers</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Stronger underwriting:</strong> validate demand drivers, customer profiles, and trade area assumptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster approvals:</strong> address traffic, access, and compatibility with evidence—not opinions.</li>
        <li><strong>Better tenant targeting:</strong> align site characteristics with tenant leasing criteria (access, visibility, adjacency, footfall).</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced entitlement risk:</strong> identify constraints early (ROW, utilities, stormwater, zoning, community sentiment).</li>
        <li><strong>Improved leasing velocity:</strong> a clear story sells the site to tenants, brokers, and capital partners.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What to analyze for CRE site selection</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and visibility:</strong> turning movements, signalization, ingress/egress, corner influence, signage visibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Trip drivers:</strong> daytime population, retail nodes, employment centers, anchors, schools, and medical corridors.</li>
        <li><strong>Demand and segmentation:</strong> who lives/works nearby and what they actually buy.</li>
        <li><strong>Competing supply:</strong> nea
