      <h1>Why Most Site Selection Decisions Fail at the Assumption Stage</h1>
      <p class="muted">Published Dec 3, 2025 · 6–8 minute read</p>

      <div class="card subtle" style="margin-top: 18px;">
        <p class="muted" style="margin:0;">
          If a site “looked great on paper” but underperformed, you probably didn’t miss the math—you missed the assumptions behind it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 26px;">The hidden failure mode: assumptions that never got written down</h2>
      <p>
        Most site selection teams are doing analysis. The problem is that the analysis is often built on inputs that are treated as facts:
        expected demand, trade area boundaries, drive-time behavior, competitor impacts, permitting timelines, construction constraints,
        or the “real” customer profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        When those inputs aren’t documented, you can’t stress-test them. And when you can’t stress-test them, you can’t defend the decision
        when leadership asks “what changed?” after performance deviates.
      </p>

      <h2>Common assumption traps that break decisions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Demand assumptions:</strong> relying on static demographic growth or outdated traffic patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive response assumptions:</strong> assuming competitors won’t react, discount, or reposition.</li>
        <li><strong>Access assumptions:</strong> ignoring right-in/right-out limitations, signal timing, or turn restrictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Timeline assumptions:</strong> underestimating permitting, utilities, or municipality review cycles.</li>
        <li><strong>Operating assumptions:</strong> assuming labor availability and staffing are “solvable later.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The fix: make assumptions explicit and testable</h2>
      <p>
        A defensible process treats assumptions like first-class objects. Each key assumption should have:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>A written statement</strong> (what you believe, exactly).</li>
        <li><strong>A source</strong> (data, stakeholder input, precedent, or field verification).</li>
        <li><strong>A confidence level</strong> (high/medium/low).</li>
        <li><strong>A sensitivity test</strong> (what happens if it’s wrong by 10–30%).</li>
        <li><strong>A monitoring plan</strong> (what would cause you to revisit the decision).</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Why executives care: approvals move faster when the logic is defensible</h2>
      <p>
        Executives don’t want more dashboards. They want decisions they can defend to investors, boards, and internal stakeholders.
        A clear assumption log + sensitivity analysis makes approvals faster and reduces rework.
      </p>
