      <h1 class="post-title">Why Most Site Selection Decisions Fail at the Assumption Stage</h1>

      <p class="post-lede">
        When site selection decisions go wrong, the failure rarely starts with construction,
        leasing, or even permitting. It almost always starts much earlier — at the
        <strong>assumption stage</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Assumptions shape every analysis that follows. Yet in many organizations, they’re
        informal, undocumented, or quietly inherited from past projects. The result is a
        decision that looks data-driven on the surface but collapses under scrutiny later.
      </p>

      <h2>The hidden role assumptions play in site selection</h2>
      <p>
        Every site selection process relies on assumptions, whether they’re stated or not:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What defines a “good” location?</li>
        <li>Which metrics matter most — and which don’t?</li>
        <li>How far customers will actually travel</li>
        <li>What future growth looks like, not just current demand</li>
        <li>What risks are acceptable versus unacceptable</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The problem isn’t that assumptions exist. The problem is that they often
        <strong>aren’t aligned, tested, or documented</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Where assumption-driven failures begin</h2>

      <h3>1) Consensus replaces clarity</h3>
      <p>
        Many teams mistake agreement for accuracy. A group may “feel good” about a site,
        but that confidence often rests on shared beliefs rather than verified evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without clearly defined criteria, consensus can mask risk — and make it harder to
        challenge weak assumptions before capital is committed.
      </p>

      <h3>2) Metrics are chosen after the favorite site emerges</h3>
      <p>
        A common failure pattern is selecting a preferred site first, then choosing metrics
        that justify it. This reverses the decision process and creates biased outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Defensible site selection requires defining assumptions and scoring logic
        <strong>before</strong> evaluating properties — not after.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Future outlook is treated as speculation</h3>
      <p>
        Teams often rely heavily on current demographics while discounting future conditions
        as “too uncertain.” Ironically, this is where some of the biggest risks live.
      </p>
      <p>
        Population shifts, infrastructure investment, zoning changes, and competitive
        movement frequently determine whether a site succeeds or underperforms over time.
      </p>

      <h3>4) Tradeoffs aren’t documented</h3>
      <p>
        No site is perfect. Every decision involves tradeoffs — access versus cost, visibility
        versus entitlement risk, near-term demand versus long-term growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        When those tradeoffs aren’t recorded, decision-makers lose context later, approvals
        slow down, and teams are forced to re-litigate choices that were already made.
      </p>

      <h2>Why assumption failures become expensive later</h2>
      <p>
        When assumptions break down, costs show up gradually:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Redesigns after constraints are discovered</li>
        <li>Permitting delays and extended carrying costs</li>
        <li>Infrastructure upgrades not included in the original pro forma</li>
        <li>Internal misalignment that stalls approvals</li>
        <li>Underperforming locations that looked “right” on paper</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These are rarely viewed as site selection failures — but that’s exactly where
        the root cause lives.
      </p>

      <h2>The fix: make assumptions explicit and defensible</h2>
      <p>
        Strong site selection processes don’t eliminate uncertainty. They make it
        visible, measurable, and defensible.
      </p>
      <p>
        That means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Defining decision criteria upfront</li>
        <li>Using consistent trade areas and metrics</li>
        <li>Documenting assumptions and data sources</li>
        <li>Recording why one site wins over another</li>
        <li>Evaluating both current conditions and future outlook</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When assumptions are clear, teams move faster, approvals become easier, and
        decisions hold up long after the project moves forward.
      </p>

      <h2>Site selection isn’t about being right — it’s about being defensible</h2>
      <p>
        The best site selection decisions aren’t the ones that avoid every risk.
        They’re the ones that can be explained, defended, and understood by anyone
        who asks, “Why did we choose this site?”
